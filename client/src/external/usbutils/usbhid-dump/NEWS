    * Command line parameters are removed, now all HID interfaces
      of all USB devices are dumped by default. This may include the
      keyboard controlling the terminal, for example, please be careful.
    * Added device selection limiting options: -s, -a, --address=bus[:dev]
      to limit by bus number and/or device address and -d, -m,
      --model=vid[:pid] to limit by vendor and/or product.
    * Added interface number limiting option -i, --interface=NUMBER.
    * Added stream interrupt transfer timeout option -t,
      --stream-timeout=NUMBER, which is set to 1 minute by default to
      allow recovery of accidentially captured terminal input device.
      This timeout is printed on the start of stream dumping.
